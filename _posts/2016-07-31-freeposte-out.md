When we started the Freeposte.io adventure back in December, we weren't quite
sure the project would lead to anything but a bunch of scripts to manage our
mail server at [TeDomum](https://tedomum.net).

About 6 month later, we have got word from a dozen individuals and half a
dozen nonprofits that have started setting up Freeposte.io or are using it
for production emails. All mailboxes at TeDomum have been running on top
of Freeposte.io for the past 5 months and happily received thousands of emails.

Release 1.0 was definitely not ready for production: the anti-spam services
were unstable, lots of junk messages still got through, there was still no
support for outgoing DKIM and thus no way to properly setup DMARC. These
have been addressed and we are really enthusiastic about releasing 1.1 and
expecting some feedback and contributions.

Please read the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/kaiyou/freeposte.io/wiki/Setup-Guide)
if you plan on setting up a new mail server. Freeposte.io is free software,
you are more than welcome to report issues, ask for features or enhancements,
or event contribute your own modifications!
